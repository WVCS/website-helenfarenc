          <h1> Welcome to Helen Farenc's Website! </h1>
    <p> Here's a Little Bit About Me: </p>
    <center>
      <p1> I am 18 years old and a senior at Westview High School. I played on the Varsity Field Hockey team in high school and was the team captain my senior year. 
        I am the Vice President of the "Make a Wish" club and I am a member of Link Crew. I am super excited for summer this year because I love playing spikeball at the beach with my friends. I also love grabbing icecream after a long day outside in the sun. Next year I will be attending the W.A. Franke Honors College at the University of Arizona. My major is currently undecided but I want to focus my studies in STEM and business.
